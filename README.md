# Generative AI for Data Augmentation in Imbalanced Datasets

## Project Overview

This project aims to use generative AI techniques to create synthetic data for addressing the problem of class imbalance in datasets. Imbalanced datasets are common in real-world scenarios and can lead to poor performance in machine learning models. By generating synthetic data points for underrepresented classes, this project seeks to create more balanced datasets, improving the performance of classification models.

## Objective

1. Implement a generative AI model, such as a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) or Variational Autoencoder (VAE), to generate synthetic data points for underrepresented classes in imbalanced datasets.
2. Evaluate the quality of the generated data by comparing it to real data points from the same class.
3. Assess the impact of the generated data on the performance of classification models.

## Dataset

For this project, we'll use the [Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) from Kaggle. This dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with only 0.172% of transactions being classified as fraudulent. The dataset has 31 features, including the `Class` feature which indicates whether a transaction is fraudulent (1) or not (0).

## Methodology

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**: Analyze the dataset, perform any necessary preprocessing, and split it into training and testing sets.

2. **Implement the Generative Model**: Choose between GAN or VAE and implement the generative AI model.

3. **Train the Generative Model**: Train the generative model on the minority class of the dataset (i.e., the fraudulent transactions) to generate synthetic data points.

4. **Evaluate the Generated Data**: Compare the generated data points to real data points from the same class using various metrics, such as t-SNE plots and statistical tests.

5. **Augment the Dataset**: Augment the original dataset with the generated data points, creating a new, more balanced dataset.

6. **Train and Evaluate Classification Models**: Train different classification models, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, on both the original and augmented datasets. Evaluate their performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve.

7. **Compare Performance**: Compare the performance of the classification models on the original and augmented datasets to assess the impact of the generated data.

## Expected Outcomes

- A generative AI model capable of generating synthetic data points for underrepresented classes in imbalanced datasets.
- An evaluation of the quality of the generated data points compared to real data points from the same class.
- An assessment of the impact of the generated data points on the performance of classification models, demonstrating the effectiveness of data augmentation using generative AI techniques.

## Future Work

- Investigate the use of other generative models, such as Wasserstein GANs or Conditional VAEs, for generating synthetic data points.
- Explore the application of this approach to other imbalanced datasets and domains, such as healthcare, finance, and cybersecurity.
- Study the potential of using generative AI models for data augmentation in semi-supervised and unsupervised learning scenarios.
